# Assignment 2 Game of Life
This is the Game of Life.

To play compile the program.


If you have a file ready to upload for your simulation select option 1 when prompted. 

If you want a random simulation press 2 and input your desired rows, columns, and population.

There are 3 game modes to choose from. The Classic Mode, Mirror Mode, and Donut Mode. Below are the rules.

Classic mode: All locations off the grid are considered to be empty.


Doughnut mode: The grid is wrapped around itself horizontally and vertically, resulting
in a torus (doughnut) shape. In this mode, any reference off the right-hand-side is
wrapped around to the left-most column of the same row and vice-versa. Any reference
off the top wraps to the bottom in the same column.


Mirror Mode: References off the grid are bounced back as though the wall were a mirror.
This means the reflection of a cell could count as its own neighbor. For a corner cell, if it was
occupied, its reflection would count as 3 neighborsâ€¦1 for the vertical reflection, l for the
horizontal reflection, and 1 for the diagonal reflection.

You can choose to have your simulation played out on the computer terminal or outputed to a file with the name of your choosing.

Have fun!
